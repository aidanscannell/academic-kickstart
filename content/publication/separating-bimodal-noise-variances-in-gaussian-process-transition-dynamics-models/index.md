abstract: "We present an approach for separating low and high noise regimes in Gaussian process transition dynamics models. We assume that our data is generated by two underlying process where the assignment of a data point to a process is governed by an implicit Riemannian manifold. As such, we are able to specify a prior distribution over this separation manifold, providing a mechanism for encoding our expert domain knowledge regarding the separation of the two regimes in input (state-action) space. It also explicitly quantifies the uncertainty in the location of the manifold. This model was developed for application to drone operations in self induced turbulence and seeks to improve the applicability of learnt dynamics models to environments that contain regimes that are subject to unmodelable stochastic effects."
