Hello, my name is Aidan Scannell and I am an aspiring researcher
with interests at the intersection of robotics and machine learning.
I grew up in North Yorkshire and graduated from the University of Bristol in 2016.
I am now a PhD researcher under the supervision of Professor Arthur Richards and Dr Carl Henrik Ek focusing on data-efficient learning for the control of robotic systems (quadcopters).
I am particularly interested in uncertainty quantification in model-based reinforcement learning and as a result a lot of my work focuses on Bayesian non-parametric methods, specifically Gaussian processes and variational inference.

I am a real programmer that [uses the butterfly effect](https://xkcd.com/378/) to program.
<!-- Joking aside, my favourite time is that dedicated to tinkering with my [dotfiles](https://github.com/aidanscannell/.dotfiles) -->
<!-- and configuring my beautiful text editor. -->

<!-- I like to place priors on the world assumptions and ignore what I observe. -->
