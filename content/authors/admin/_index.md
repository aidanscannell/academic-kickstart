My name is Aidan Scannell and I am a PhD researcher at the *University of Bristol* and the *Bristol Robotics Laboratory* under the supervision of Professor Arthur Richards and Dr Carl Henrik Ek. Whilst completing my degree I developed a keen interest in mathematics, programming and robotics and became fascinated by how they form a common connection between humans and the surrounding world. 

My research is focused on data-efficient machine learning for the control of robotic systems.
I am particularly interested in uncertainty quantification in model-based reinforcement learning and as a result a lot of my work focuses on Bayesian non-parametric methods, specifically Gaussian processes and variational inference.
